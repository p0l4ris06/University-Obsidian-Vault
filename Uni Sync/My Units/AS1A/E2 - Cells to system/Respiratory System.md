## Structure
- Lungs and respiratory passages

## Function
- Oxygen and carbon dioxide exchange between blood and air
- Regulates blood pH
## Passages
- Structure
	- Nasal cavity warms and humidifies inspired air
	- Pharynx is cross-over point
	- Larynx for phonation and protection
- Nasal/mouth breathing
- Trachea - incomplete cartilage rings

# Lungs
- Organs of respiration
- Site of gaseous exchange
- Receive deoxygenated blood via pulmonary arteries
- Lobes
- Many species variations
	- Spongy due to millions of alveoli in mammals
	- Non-tidal flow in aves
	- Simple sacs in reptiles
	- Cutaneous respiration in modern amphibians
