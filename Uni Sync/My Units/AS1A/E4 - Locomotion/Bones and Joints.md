# Bones
## Function
- Mechanical support
- Protection
- Movement
- [[Haematopoiesis]]
- Calcium metabolism

## Bone classification
- Long bones
	- Typically longer than wide
	- Shaft with heads at both ends
	- Mainly compact bone
- Short bones
	- Generally cube-shaped
	- Mostly spongy bones
- Flat bones
	- Thin and flattened, usually curved
	- Thin layers of compact bone around a layer of spongy bone
- Irregular bone
	- Do not fit into other classification categories

## Specialist bones
- Sesamoid bones
	- Within tendon or ligament
- Pneumatic bones
	- Contain air filled sinuses
- Splanchnic bones
	- Unattached to rest of skeleton

## Anatomy of:
### Long bones
- Diaphysis
	- Shaft
	- Compact bone
- Epiphysis
	- Ends of bone
	- Spongy bone
### Flat, short and irregular bones
- No diaphysis, epiphysis or medullary cavity
- Compact bone and cancellous (spongy) bone

## Bone development
- Ossification
	- Process by which bone is formed
	- Intramembranous ossification
		- Fibrous tissue precursor
		- Development of an ossification centre
		- Calcification
		- Formulation of trabeculae
		- Development of Periosteum
	- Endochondral ossification
		- Cartilage precursor
