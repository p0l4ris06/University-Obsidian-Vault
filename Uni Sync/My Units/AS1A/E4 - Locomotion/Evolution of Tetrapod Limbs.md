## The axial skeleton
- Skull
- [[Vertebral column]]
- Bony thorax

## The appendicular skeleton
- Appendages
- Pectoral girdle
- Pelvic girdle

# Modes of tetrapedal locomotion
- Cursorial
- Fossorial
- Saltatorial
- Aerial
- Arboreal

# Origin of limbs
- Theories for move to land from water 
	- Move between pools of water in times of drought 
	- To escape predation in water 
	- To find food on land
- Likely the move happened several times - separate movements

## Modification of limbs
- Cursorial modifications
	- Longer limbs
	- Increased [[Flexion]]and [[Extension]]of vertebral column

### Plantigrade
- Walking on soles of feet
- Heel ([[Tarsal bone]]), [[Metatarsals]]and [[Phalanges]]in contact with the ground
### Digitigrade
- Only [[Phalanges]] contact ground
- Ankle [[Tarsus]]/Wrist [[Carpus]] elevated
### Unguligrade
- Only distal [[Phalanx]] (tip of one or two digits) in contact with the ground
