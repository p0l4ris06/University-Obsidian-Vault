# Temperature

## Why?
- Regular monitoring
- Recorded
- Trends
- Changes

## Normal ranges
Dog: 38.3-39.2
Cat: 38.2-38.6
Horse: 38.0-38.2
Domestic rabbit: 38.5-40.0

### Types of thermometer
- Digital
- Mercury
- Biotherm
- Oesophageal

### Types of changes in temperature
- Pyrexia: increase in body temperature due to infection
- Hypothermia: low body temperature
- Hyperthermia: raised body temperature due to environmental factors

## How to take a rectal temperature
- Have a colleague restrain patient 
- Lubricate the thermometer
- Insert with a twisting motion
- With the thermometer flat, push it towards the dorsal aspect of the rectum to avoid being in faeces
- Hold in place for 30s-1min
- Record on patient records

### Causes of abnormal temperature
#### Hyperthermia V Pyrexia:
- Infection
- Heat stroke
- Convulsions
- Pain
- Excitement
- Clinical conditions/diseases
#### Hypothermia:
- Shock
- Circulatory collapse
- Impending partuition
- General anaesthesia

Diphasic: Fluctuating temperature (spiking)

# Pulse
## Pulse rates
Dog: 60-180bpm
Cat: 110-18bpm
Horse: 32-44bpm

### Pulse locations
#### Central:
- Femoral
	- Medial aspect of the femur
#### Peripheral:
= Give an early indication of peripheral shut down
- Digital
	- Palmer aspect of the carpus
- Tarsal
	- Medial aspect of the tarsus
- Lingual
	- Ventral aspect of the tongue

### How to take a pulse rate
- Ask a colleague to restrain patient
- Locate the artery of choice with fingers
- Count the pulsations for 15/30/60s
- Record pulse rate on patient records

## Pulse quality and character
- Sinus arrhythmia 
	- Normal variation in rate. The pulse speeds up with inspiration and decreases with expiration
- Weak pulses
	- Indicate reduced circulating blood volume
- Strong and jerky pulses
	- Can indicate reduced circulatory volume or other cardiac abnormalities but there is a temporary compensatory mechanism in place
- [[Tachycardia]]
	- Increased heart and pulse rates. Causes can vary:
		- Excitement
		- Exercise
		- Hypoxia
		- Pain
		- Fear
		- Shock
		- Pyrexia

- [[Bradycardia]]
	- Decreased heart and pulse rates. Causes can vary:
		- Unconsciousness
		- Anaesthesia
		- Debilitating disease 
		- Sleep
## How to take a heart rate
- Important patient is relaxed
- Have the patient restrained in standing position
- Place stethoscope head on lower left chest between 3<sup>rd</sup> and 6<sup>th</sup> ribs
### How to take a heart rate using a pulse oximeter
- Sensors are placaed on the skin/mucous membranes
- Light is emitted from the pulse oximeter and passes through the blood in the tissue.
- Peripheral circulation is needed
- Not possible in patients with severe circulatory failure
- Difficult to use on patients with pigmented skin or mucous membranes
### Using an oesophageal stethoscope 
- Patient must be anaesthetised 
- Premeasure the approximate length for insertion, not the length from the level of the canine teeth to the point of the olecranon

# Respiration
- Best assessed when the patient is at rest
- Count inspirations OR expirations
- Record on patients hospital sheet
- Important to note the respiratory effort as well as the rate

## Respiratiory terminology
- Dyspnoea
	- Difficulty breathing
- Inspiratoryn dyspnoea
	- Obstruction or narrowing of the [[Trachea]]
- Expiratory dyspnoea
	- Bronchitis or pleural adhesions
- Mixed dyspnoea
	- Pneumonia
	- Pneumothorax
	- Hydrothorax
	- Pyothorax
- Orthopnoea
	- When a patient changes to assist respiration
- Stridor
	- Breathing associated with upper airway construction
- Stertor
	- Snoring [[Brachycephalic Obstructive Airway Syndrome]]
- Paradoxical breathing
	- Abnormal respiratory pattern
	- Diaphragm moves upwards during inspiration and downwards during expiration
- Wheezee
	- High-pitched whistling sound normally on exhalation
- Cyanotic
	- Blue mucous membranes
- Rhoncus
	- Coarse rattling sound
- Flail chest
	- Occurs when a segment of the rib cage breaks due to trauma and becomes detached from the rest of the chets wall
	- The damaged area moves slightly on inspiration and expiration 
- Tachypnoea
	- Increased respiratory rate
		- Heat
		- Exercise
		- Pain
		- Poisons
		- Excitement
- Bradypnoea
	- Decreased respiratory rate
		- Poisons
		- Sleep 
		- Anaesthesia
- Cheyne stokes
	- The respiratory pattern that occurs shortly before death (PTS)
	- Characterised by alternating deep and shallow breathing
- Apnoea
	- Cessation of breathing

# Blood pressure

## Mean blood pressure
- Average arterial blood pressure during a cardiac cycle
- 60-85mmHg normal
#### Indirect arterial blood pressure (oscillometric technique)
- Similar to doppler technique
- Cuff technique 
#### Indirect arterial blood pressure (doppler technique)
- Systolic blood pressure measurement
- Distal limb or tail placement
- Less accurate but can be carried out in conscious patients
