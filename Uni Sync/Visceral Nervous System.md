### Enteric nervous system
##### Sympathetic effects
- Dilates pupil
- Triggers goosebumps to conserve heat
- Vasoconstriction of peripheral vessels
- Increases sweating
- Decreased secretion of tears
- Thicker, more viscous saliva (also decreases secretion)
- Increased cardiac output through increased stroke volume and heart rate
- Dilation of bronchi and reduced secretions
- Reduced GI mobility and blood flow
- Contraction of GI and urinary sphincters for continence
- Breakdown of glycogen to glucose in the liver
- Vasoconstriction of renal vessels to reduce urine formation
- Ejaculation
- Release of adrenaline from adrenal medulla
##### Parasympathetic effects
- Constriction of pupil
- Accommodation of lens for near vision
- Secretion of tears
- Secretion of watery saliva
- Reduced cardiac output through reduced heart rate and stroke volume
- Reduced coronary blood supply
- Constriction and reduced secretion in bronchi
- Stimulation of peristalsis and secretion of digestive juices and bile
- Relaxation of GI and urinary sphincters for defaecation and urination
- Production of glycogen from glucose
- Contraction of bladder for urination
- Erection
