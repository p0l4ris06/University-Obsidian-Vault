- Two key structures make up the [[Nervous System]]
- [[Neural plate]] from [[Ectoderm]] which then rolls up into a tubular structure and buds off from the ectoderm, adopting a central position within the embryo
- [[Neural crest Cells]] at the edges of the neural plate also separate - migratory aggregates with multiple functions
