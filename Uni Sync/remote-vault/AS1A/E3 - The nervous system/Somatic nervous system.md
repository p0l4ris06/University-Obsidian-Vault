#ANAT10008/AS1A 

---
- Refers to [[Sensory Neuron]]s and [[Motor Neuron]]s that arise from/go to regions of the body, **other** than the viscera or internal organs

## Nerve cell types
- [[Afferent]]
- [[Efferent]]
- Interneurons

Afferent nerve types can either be general or specialised according to the sense detected
- General sensation refers to touch, vibration etc.
- Specialised sensation refers to the special senses e.g. vision, hearing, balance, taste, smell 

## Function
- Involved within the detection of stimuli from the external environment and control of the skeletal muscles
- Both sensory and motor functions

### Spinal nerves
- Regions:
	- Cervical
	- Thoracic
	- Lumbar
	- Sacral
	- Caudal/Coccygeal
- Both motor and sensory componenets
- Ventral rami of spinal nerves form collections called plexuses

### Dermatomes and myotomes
- Dermatome - area of skin supplied by the [[Afferent]] fibres of **one single** spinal nerve
- Myotome - group of muscles supplied by [[Efferent]] fibres of **one single** spinal nerve

# Plexus
## Types of plexuses
### Spinal plexuses
- Spinal nerves containing mixed motor and sensory fibres join e.g. [[Brachial plexus]] and [[Lumbosacral plexus]]
### Autonomic plexuses
- Splanchnic nerves containing autonomic fibres join e.g. coeliac plexus and myenteric plexus

# Spinal Reflexes and nerve arcs
## Spinal reflex
- A reflex where the nervous pathway coordinating this relay involves a sensory fibre which feeds into the spinal cord conveying information regarding the stimulus, activating a motor neurone in the cord which brings about the appropriate response
## Nerve arcs
- A spinal reflex in its simplest form - there are others which involve other neurones and a reflex may also be under control or influence from other areas in the CNS e.g. the [[Brain]]

# Spinal nerve
- Pairs of spinal nerves - spinal segment
- Roots converge
- Roots formed by rootlets

# Types of spinal tracts
- There are two main groups of tracts found in the spinal cord
	- Those which transfer sensory information towards the brain i.e. ascending tracts
		- These tend to be found in the more dorsal regions of the cord
	- Those which transfer motor information in a descending direction back to the [[Peripheral Nervous System]] i.e. descending tracts
		- These tend to be found in the more ventral regions of the cord
