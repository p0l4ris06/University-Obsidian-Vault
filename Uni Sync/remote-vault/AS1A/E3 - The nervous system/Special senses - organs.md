## Eye development
- The optic cup forms the retina and contributes to formation of the ciliary body and iris. The outer wall of the cup forms the outer pigmented layer of the retina, and the inner wall forms neural layers of the retina
- The optic stalk becomes the optic nerve as it fills with axons traveling from the retina to the [[Brain]]
- The lens vesicle develops into the lens, consisting of layers of lens fibers enclosed within an elastic capsule
- The vitreous compartment develops from the concavity of the optic cup, and the vitreous body is formed from ectomesenchyme that enters the compartment through the optic fissure
### Components of the visual apparatus
- Globe - eyeball - housed in orbit in lots of fat
- Adnexa - structures which surround or attach to the globe
- Eyelids
- Orbit - bony construct comprised of: zygomatic, sphenoid, maxillary, frontal, palatine, ethmoid and lacrimal bones
- Lacrimal apparatus - produces tears
- Extrinsic muscles - move eyeball in orbit

## Tunics/layers of the eye
- Outer fibrous tunic
	- Cornea and sclera
		- Continuous layer
- Middle vascular tunic (uveal tract)
	- Iris - controls size of pupil
		- Suspends lens and regulates its curvature - process called accommodation
		- Produces aqueous humour
	- Choroid
		- Supplies blood
		- Has light reflecting layer in some species (Tapetum lucidum)
- Inner nervous tunic (retina)
	- Outer pigmented layer (pars ceca retina)
		- From optic nerve to pupillary margin
	- Inner non-pigmented layer (pars optica retina)

## Visual pathways
- Optic nerve
- Optic chiasm where lateral visual field fibres decussate over
- Optic tract
- Lateral geniculate nucleus in [[Thalamus]]
- Visual cortex in [[Occipital lobe]]

## Anatomy of the ear
### Middle ear
- Housed in petrous part of temporal bone
- Air-filled space: the [[Tympanic cavity]]
- [[Tympanic bulla]] associated - prominence on ventral skull

### Inner ear
- Semi-circular canals
- Filled with fluid - endolymph
- Innervation by cochlear division of [[Vestibulocochlear nerve]]: CN VIII
