## Types of sensory receptors
- Most sensory receptors translate light, mechanical or chemical stimuli into electrical
- Tip of sensory nerve fibre is associated that amplify the stimulus and increase the sensitivity
### General sensory organs
- Free
- Encapsulated nerve endings
	- Meissner corpuscle - light touch - in the [[Dermis]]
	- Corpuscle of Ruffini - dual mechanoreceptor and thermoreceptor capabilities
	- End bulb Krause - thermoreceptors: cold
	- Pacinian corpuscles - skin, joints, deep tissues
- Free nerve endings
	- Terminus of sensory process lacks any special ending or particular association - free nerve ending
	- Branch extensively to increase area monitored
- Pain - extremes of heat and cold
- Tissue damage leads to swelling and direct stimulation


- Associated sensory receptors
	- Wrapped around another organ
	- Base of hair follicle etc
	- Proprioception
	- Located in muscles, tendons and joints - degree of muscle contraction
	- [[Central Nervous System]] kept informed about position of limbs in space
- Muscle spindles
	- Intrafusal muscles
	- Maintain muscle tone
	- Muscle contains small amount of tension even when relaxed - tone adjusted 
	- Relayed to cerebellum to modulate muscle activity
- Golgi tendon organs
	- Sensory structures in the tendons that attach to bone
	- Tension recorded about forces generated in muscles
- Mechanoreceptors
	- Hair cells (microvilli and cilia)
	- Mechanical into electrical impulses
	- Hearing
	- Balance
	- Lateral line system - pressure and movement in the water and spatial awareness (Neuromasts)
	- Echolocation
- Radiation receptors
	- UV
	- IR
	- Light vision
