# Muscles
## Types:
- Smooth 
- Striated (Skeletal)
- Cardiac

### Striated (Skeletal)
- Attached to skeleton to bring about movement
- Has intercalated discs
- Terminology:
	- Contraction and relaxation
	- Eccentric and concentric contraction
	- Muscle tone
	- Hypertrophy and atrophy
#### Function:
- Movement of body parts and organ contents
- Maintain posture and provide stability
- Communication - speech, expression and writing
- Control of openings and passageways
- Body heat production
- Aid venous return

- Origin - usually stationary end of muscle
- Belly - thicker, middle region of muscle
- Insertion - usually mobile end of muscle

#### Muscle contractions
- Isotonic
	- Cause muscle to change length
	- Concentric - muscle shortens as it contracts
	- Eccentric - muscle lengthens as it contracts against a force
- Isometric
	- No change in muscle length

#### Skeletal muscle shapes
- Fusiform muscles
	- Thick in middle and tapered at ends
- Convergent muscles
	- Broad at origin and tapering to a narrower insertion
- Parallel muscles
	- Parallel fascicles 
	- Rectus abdominis m.
- Circular muscles
	- Acts as sphincters
	- Ring around body opening
	- Orbicularis oris
- Pennate muscles
	- Fascicles insert obliquely on a tendon
	- Unipennate, bipennate or multipennate
	- Palmar interosseus, rectus femoris and deltoid

#### Muscle groups
- Muscle compartments
	- Share same function(s)
	- Share same nerve supply
- Deep fascia
	- Found between adjacent muscles
- Superficial fascia ([[Hypodermis]])
	- Found between skin and muscles
	- Contains adipose tissue

## Connective tissues of a muscle
### Epimysium
- Covers whole muscle belly
- Blends into [[Connective tissue]] that separates muscles
### Perimysium
- Slightly thicker layer of connective tissue
- Surrounds a bundle of cells called a fascicle
### Endomysium
- Thin layer of areolar tissue surrounding each cell
- Allows room for capillaries and nerve fibers

## Types of fibres
### Type I fibres
- Slow twitch
- Fatigue resistant
- Aerobic
### Type II fibres
- Fast twitch
- Fatigue rapidly
- Anaerobic

## Skeletal muscle organisation
### Muscle hierarchy
- Bundles (fascicles)
- Fibres (cells)
- Myofibrils
- Myofilaments (actin and myosin)

- Regular arrangements of actin and myosin results in striations
- Sarcomere - basic contractile unit of skeletal muscle
- I-band - only actin
- A-band - length of the myosin
- H-band - gap between two ends of actin
- Z-line

# ***FIND NOTES ON SLIDING FILAMENT THEORY***
## Neuromuscular junction
- [[Motor Neuron]]s are specialised nerve cells which initiate contraction of skeletal muscle
- Axon of motor neuron has multiple branches - each branch synapsing with a single muscle fibre at neuromuscular junction
- Presynaptic terminals of axon synapse with muscle cells at post-synaptic membrane
	- Aka motor-end plate
- Presynaptic (axon) terminal
	- ++ Mitochondria
	- Synaptic vesicles contain acetylcholine (ACh)
- Post-synaptic membrane (motor end plate)
	- Specialised region of sarcolemma which has folded surface
	- Crests house ACh receptors and Na<sup>+</sup> channels

## Muscle spindles
## Golgi tendon organs
## Muscle attachments


# Tendons
- Muscle --> bone
- Transmit force from muscle to bone
	- Energy store

# Ligaments
- Bone --> bone
- Capsular
- Extra-capsular
- Intra-capsular
